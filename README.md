# Udacity_DL_Project1_BikeSharing_Pattern_detect

This is the project for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Project 1. The project aims to detect the pattern of bike-sharing rental system.

The main folder includes a dataset folder and some visualization files supplied by Udacity Cooperation. The Jupyter Notebook file and the python Script were framed by the nanodegree program, developed by myself to meet the rubric of the project. 

The code was adapted to use Python version 3.7. Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Torchvision, and PyTorch are needed to run the application.

You can install all the packages mentioned above by running the following command in a conda environment:

`
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook pytorch torchvision
`

or use pip3 install to install the packages to your computer locally. 

The model was trained on time-sequential data, taking the first 10 days as input for training the data and testing the performance of the model of the next 10 days. It is a well-designed project which offered a brief introduction to the fundamental concepts in deep learning and helps people get familiar with the training/validation process.
